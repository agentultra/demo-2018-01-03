Got stuck a little on input logic today which ate up a good 20-25 mins.

At about 40 mins started adding level loading and background tile drawing. Got a little stuck again on
the tile drawing loop which ate 5-10 mins.

Not bad. Will probably get further next time.

## Get Started

    $ yarn start
